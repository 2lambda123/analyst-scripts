# HTTP Tests

Bunch of random scripts to tests stuff on web servers :
* `check_fun_files.py` : test if a list of files exist on the server (python2/3, minimal imports)
    * `fun_files.txt` : handmade list of interesting files (used by default, quite limited ~20 tests)
    * `phishingkits.txt` : list of phishing kit names imported from https://github.com/0xd34db33f/scriptsaw/blob/master/ruby/phish_kit_finder.rb
* `http_test_methods.py`: test different HTTP methods on the server (python2 only)
* `http_test.py` : test different HTTP headers (python2)
* `headers.py` : show server's headers (python2)
* `watch_response_time.py` : download and log server's response time (python2)
* `server_image_fingerprint.py` : fingerprint the web server based on images accessible (python2)
* `plot_response_time.sh` : show server's response time based on log generated by `watch_response_time.py` (uses gnuplot)
* `waf` : script to bypass Web Applicaton Firewall (python2, old)
